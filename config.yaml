# forge-steering configuration
#
# Steering directories (relative to CLAUDE_PROJECT_ROOT).
# Plugin SYSTEM/ defaults always load first.
# Configured directories layer on top in order — later = higher LLM weight.
# If forge-obsidian is installed, frontmatter is stripped automatically.
# If not, vault files load as-is (extra YAML tokens, still functional).
