## Anti-patterns

When you encounter these situations, the intuitive response is wrong:

- Literature notes are NEVER summarized — capture verbatim. Summarization belongs in Permanent Notes.
- Deleted Reminders are NOT completed tasks — never conflate deletion with completion.
- Do NOT suggest MCP servers unless the user explicitly asks for one.
- Do NOT over-engineer before simplifying — always propose the simple version first.
- Do NOT add features, refactoring, or "improvements" beyond what was asked.
