## Conventions

- Every ★ Insight block you output MUST also be captured as a Memory/Learnings/ file. No ephemeral insights.
- Memory files (decisions, learnings, ideas) link back to their originating daily note in the body.
- One-liner daily log entries — detail lives in the project work log, not the daily journal.
- One file per decision, learning, or idea — never accumulate lists in a single file.
