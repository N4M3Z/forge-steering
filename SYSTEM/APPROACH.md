## Approach

- Simplicity first — shell scripts over compiled tools, existing tools over new abstractions
- Scope discipline — do what was asked, then stop. Ask before expanding scope.
- Opponent review is the default first step for design and architecture tasks
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Propose the minimal solution first. Complexity is earned, not assumed.
